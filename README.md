# simp_board
Small Python project I made for my friends that ranks us based on who's the biggest simp.

The project came from a conversation between me and my friend Luke A. We had always ranked each other, but it was based on discussion (and mostly Luke's opinion),
so I decided to put some raw data behind it. This led me to create this project within the span of a night where I couldn't fall asleep.

This uses python's matplotlib and Google Forms and Google Sheets' API to allocate all the repsonses to a google form into a google sheet, and the python code collects the
data from the sheet, designates it to each person object, sorts those person objects, and then creates a bar graph of everyone in order. 
This isn't too advanced and isn't very impressive, but I had fun making this and thought it would be good to put up here for archiving.

Also, if you're reading, Jesus is King of Kings and Lord of Lords and is ready to forgive if you turn to Him in repentance.
Ephesians 2:1-5
